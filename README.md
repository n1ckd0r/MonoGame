=======
* The MonoGame 2.x series is now in maintenance mode.
* MonoGame 3.0 will mark the start of full support for the entire XNA API.
* The Content Pipeline is currently under development. This will allow compiling of assets to optimized formats for the MonoGame supported platforms in Visual Studio or MonoDevelop without requiring XNA Game Studio 4.0 installed.
* SuperGiant Games have a version working in Google Chrome Native Client which we will merge back into our tree.
* Raspberry Pi has been shown to be working, but still needs some work.
